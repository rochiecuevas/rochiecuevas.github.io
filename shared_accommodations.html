<p>San Francisco is <a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/most-visited-us-cities-2017-12?r=UK&IR=T">
  one of the most visited cities in the USA</a>. It attracts about 
  <a href = "https://www.sftravel.com/article/san-francisco-travel-reports-record-breaking-year-tourism">25 
  million visitors</a>, with tourism being its biggest industry. With many visitors streaming in, residents have 
  started renting out their spaces for 
  <a href =  "https://businessportal.sfgov.org/start/starter-kits/short-term-rental">short durations</a> 
  for extra income and use <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_property_rental">
  peer-to-peer property rental</a> platforms such as Airbnb to list their available spaces. Therefore, there 
  are four main types of accommodations considered in this report: owned homes, long-term rental properties, 
  peer-to-peer short-term rental properties, and hotels. This study explores trends in prices for these 
  accommodation types in San Francisco. </p>

<p>Data on accommodation rates in the different neighbourhoods of San Francisco are obtained from different 
  sources: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href = "https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Assessor-Historical-Secured-Property-Tax-
      Rolls/wv5m-vpq2/data">DataSF</a>, home prices</li>
    <li><a href = "https://www.zillow.com/san-francisco-ca/home-values/">Zillow</a>, long-term rental rates</li>
    <li><a href = "https://sfgov.org/scorecards/tourism">SF City Performance Scorecards</a>, hotel rates</li>
    <li><a href = "http://insideairbnb.com/san-francisco/?neighbourhood=&filterEntireHomes=
      false&filterHighlyAvailable=false&filterRecentReviews=false&filterMultiListings=false">Inside Airbnb</a>, 
      short-term rental rates</li>
  </ul>

<p>The data from the different sources are 
  <a href = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations#data-cleaning">cleaned</a>, 
  <a href = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations#data-processinganalyses">processed</a>, 
 and <a href = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/shared_accommodations#data-visualisation">visualised</a> using
 Python scripts written in different jupyter notebooks. </p>

<h4><b>Home Prices</b></h4>
<p>Results indicate that the housing price was highest in 2011 and 2016, on average, in the Financial District 
  while the most affordable neighbourhoods to own a home were Silver Tree and Visitacion Valley.</p>

  width = "900px">

<h4><b>Long-term rent</b></h4>
<p>It is notable that long-term rental rates in the Financial District were not as different as the other 
  neighbourhoods. Three neighbourhoods popped out having higher long-term rental rates in 2011 and in 2016: 
  Presidio Heights, Sea Cliff, and St. Francis Wood. Sea Cliff and St. Francis Wood are classified as 
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Residence_Parks">"residence parks"</a>. 
  <a href = "https://www.compass.com/neighborhood-guides/sf/presidio-heights/">Presidio Heights</a> took the 
  top spot for rental rates; these could be attributed to its proximity to nature despite its closeness to the 
  hustle and bustle of the City.</p>

<p>The trends in price of accommodations increased from 2011 to 2016. However, the rates of increases are 
  different. The home price increases were more gradual than that for long-term rental rate. From 2012 to 2015, 
  the increase in long-term rental rates was steep; but the increases seemed to slow down in 2015–2016.</p>

<h4><b>Hotel rates</b></h4>
<p>Hotel rates also went up between 2005 and 2017. There was a drop in hotel rates between 2008 and 2009, but 
  this can probably be attributed to the Recession during that time. Since 2009, however, the hotel rates grew 
  at a rate faster then in 2005–2008. In 2015–2017, the data suggests that the increase in hotel rates is 
  slowing down.</p>

timeseries01.svg?sanitize=true"
  width = "900px">  

  <h4><b>Short-term rent</b></h4>  
<p>The slowing growth trend for both hotel and long-term rental rates might be an effect of the entry of peer-
  to-peer short-term rental options. The short-term rental rates appeared to by highest in Presidio and 
  Presidio Heights, mimicking patterns of long-term rental rates. The rates were lowest in 
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocker-Amazon,_San_Francisco">Crocker Amazon</a> in 2015 
  and 2016; but by 2017, the rates there have overtaken those of 
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excelsior_District,_San_Francisco">Excelsior</a>, 
  <a href = "https://sftreasureisland.org/living-treasure-island">Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island</a>, 
  and Visitacion Valley. Crocker Amazon and Excelsior are described as ethnically diverse residential areas, 
  with single-family homes. Treasure Island/Yerba Buena Island, on the other hand, feature only rental housing. 
  In 2018, all short-term rental listings for Treasure Island have been 
  <a href = "https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/SF-short-term-rentals-transformed-as-
  Airbnb-12617798.php">wiped out</a> because the agency handling rentals does not allow vacation rentals.</p>

<p>In terms of districts, Western Addition and Outside Lands experienced a continuous increase in short-term 
  rental rates. In contrast, there was a price decrease from 2016 to 2017 in Downtown, in North of Downtown, 
  and in Southern districts. The number of listings of peer-to-peer short-term rental clearly increased from 
  2015 to 2017. In 2015 and 2016, Outside Lands had the fewest listings for peer-to-peer short-term property 
  rental. By 2017, however, the district already had the same number of listings as North of Downtown. On the 
  other hand, Western Addition had the most number of listings for the three years.</p>

    </div>

<p>Zooming into the neighbourhood level, it is clear that Mission, South of Market, and Western Addition had 
  the most number of listings for peer-to-peer short-term rental units across the three years. On the other 
  hand, Presidio and Treasure Island had fewest listings.</p>

<p>Heatmaps show the progression in the number of short-term rental listings and rates. It is interesting to 
  note that there were two regions of particularly high rates for short-term rental properties(northern part of 
  the City and near Twin Peaks); however, the rates spiked for most neighbourhoods in the next two years. The 
  rates rose faster around the Downtown and North of Downtown areas than around Twin Peaks. On the other hand, 
  there was only one hotspot for short-term rental listings in 2015. It was concentrated around the central part 
  of the City; however, the listings quickly spread in the subsequent years, with a second concentration 
  growing around the Downtown and South of Market areas.</p>
