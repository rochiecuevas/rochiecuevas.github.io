<h3><b>October 14th, 2018: Cloudy with a chance of meatballs?</b></h3>
<p>WeatherPy is a tool that creates scatterplots of weather metrics by geolocation for more than 500 
  randomly selected cities. The code is written in Python and can be found in a 
  <a href = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/WeatherPy/blob/master/WeatherPy.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a>.</p>
<p>On October 14th, WeatherPy was used to randomly select a set of 629 cities from all over the world out 
  of 2000 coordinates. Plotting the cities on a grid of latitudes (y-axis) and longitudes (x-axis) revealed 
  that the cities followed the general shapes of the different continents. It revealed that many cities follow 
  the coastlines; inner parts of of Africa, of Australia, and of South America had sparsely dotted regions 
  (i.e., not a lot of cities were selected from these areas). The sparse region in Australia is most likely 
  the desert 
  <a href = "http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/national-location-information/landforms/deserts">Outback</a>. 
  In South America, the empty regions could include the 
  <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/place/Patagonia-region-Argentina">Patagonian Steppe</a> (Argentina), 
  <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/colombia-desert-la-guajira/index.html">La Guajira desert</a> 
  (Colombia), and the Amazon rainforest. More cities were selected south of the equator in Africa; the northern 
  part of the continent has fewer cities because it is dominated by the 
  <a href = "https://www.livescience.com/23140-sahara-desert.html">Sahara desert</a>. It was notable that 
  cities from small island nations in the Pacific and the Atlantic were included in the random selection.

    Temperatures recorded on October 14, 2018 indicate that cities between the Equator and the 20th parallel 
    north registered the warmest conditions. As cities grew farther north from the Equator, the temperature 
    dropped. Likewise, the temperatures observed in the cities below the Equator went lower as they approached 
    the South Pole. It was also observed that the temperatures were lower in the cities between the 40th and the
    60th parallel north than in the cities between the 40th and the 60th parallel south.

  <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/humidity/">Humidity</a> is the concentration of 
  moisture in the air. Unlike temperature which has a recognisable pattern, the data for humidity suggests that 
  there is no direct linear relationship between humidity and latitude. However, cities in the 
  <a href = "https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/tropics/">tropics</a> (between -23.5° and 23.5°) 
  tended to have less variation in humidity than cities in the 
  <a href = "http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit5/unit5_sub1.htm">temperate regions</a> (north: 
  23.5–66.5° and south: -23.5– -66.5°). At the polar north, the cities tended to have humidiy readings close 
  to 100%.

  There was no noticeable pattern between cloudiness and latitude.

  <br/>

  Wind speeds indicate that there were no active typhoons or hurricanes in the randomly selected cities because 
  the wind speed records were below <a href = "https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php">74 mph</a>. On the other 
  hand, winds had more uniform speeds in cities located near the Equator and the speeds became more varied the 
  farther north or south the cities were. In the Southern Hemisphere, the area around 40 and 50° latitude is 
  known as the <a href = "https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/roaring-forties.html">"Roaring Forties"</a> 
  because of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale">gale force winds</a>. But on this particular day, 
  the wind was relatively weak, with only one city registering wind at around 34 mph. Near the Equator, the 
  winds are typically <a href = "https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/doldrums.html">calm</a> because the air in 
  here tend to go upwards, which causes low movement of air on the surface.

  There was no apparent relation between longitude and temperature. However, on October 14th, the temperatures 
  in cities at the Prime Meridian were less varied than the temperatures to east or to the west of the Prime 
  Meridian.

  <br/><br/>

  <img src = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/WeatherPy/blob/master/Images/long_temp_20181014.png?raw=True">

  <br/>

  Likewise, there was no observable trend between longitude and humidity.

  <br/><br/>

  <br/>

  The amount of cloud cover also did not appear to be related with the distance of each city from the Prime 
  Meridian.

  <br/><br/>

  <br/>

  From east to west, the winds in the selected cities were mostly slow-moving. Based on the scatterplot, wind 
  speeds tended to vary more at longitudes that coincide with longer landmasses (north to south). With the range 
  largely uniform, the plot indicates that the variation is on the distance from the Equator rather than the 
  distance from the Prime Meridian.

  <br/><br/>

  <br/>

  There was no obvious relationship between wind speed and humidity. But this graph indicates that most of the 
  cities included in the study had 60–100% humidity. This indicates that more human settlements are found in 
  more humid areas than in arid deserts, supporting the presumption that the sparse areas inside landmass 
  outlines in the latitude-longitude matrix are deserts. And with the cities dotting the coastline, it is just 
  expected to observe the predominance of humid cities.

  <br/><br/>

  <br/>

  Though cities with humidity ranging from 0 to 100% could have 0% cloudiness, it was observed that the range of 
  cloudiness tended to increase with humidity.

  <br/><br/>

  <img src = "https://github.com/rochiecuevas/WeatherPy/blob/master/Images/hum_cloud_20181014.png?raw=True">

  <br/>

  Cloudiness did not seem to be related with wind speed.
