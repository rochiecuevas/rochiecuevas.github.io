      <p>San Francisco is one of the most visited cities in the world. It's pretty expensive to stay in it too. This study explores the different accommodations rates in the City's neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p>After this study, I learned that SF's borders go beyond the downtown area and the financial district.</p>
